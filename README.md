# Generify !!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

Website to automate generation of Spotify playlists.

## Website

The website is currently **under construction** but can be visited [here](https://generify.azurewebsites.net).  
Please note that the site could take up to 30s to boot up because of the free Azure Service Plan which doesn't involve always-on functionality.  
Some time in the future I will change that *(might just host it somewhere else)* but first I need to get this project going!

## Dependencies

- [SpotifyApi-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) to access Spotify's API
- [EF Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) for database access (Azure Cosmos DB)
